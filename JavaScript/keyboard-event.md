# Keyboard Event

## ~~keyCode~~, key, code

`KeyboardEvent.keyCode` is now deprecated (because of the inconsistency across platforms). It should be used for compatibility purpose only.

Instead, `KeyboardEvent.key` or `KeyboardEvent.code` is recommended.

Difference between `key` and `code`

- `key`: return information about the character generated by the key (considering current keyboard layout, locale, modifier keys)
  - Example : if you press 'ㅈ', `key` is 'ㅈ'
  - Use case : text input
- `code` : return information about the physical key that was pressed
  - Example : if you press 'ㅈ', `code` is 'KeyW'
  - Use case : WASD keys for a game
- (Check `key` and `code` for each key)[https://keycode.info/]

## ~~keypress~~, keydown, keyup

`keypress` event is fired when a key that produces a character value is pressed down. So it's not fired when you press a key like Shift or CapsLock. It is deprecated now.

Instead, `keydown` or `keyup` is recommended. While `keypress` event indicates which character was typed in, `keydown` and `keyup` events indicate which key was pressed/released.

- Example :
  - If you type 'a',
    - `keypress` : keyCode 97
    - `keydown`, `keyup` : keyCode 65
  - If you type 'A',
    - `keypress` : keyCode 65
    - `keydown`, `keyup` : keyCode 65

Difference between `keydown` and `keyup`

- `keydown` event is fired when a key is pressed
- `keyup` event is fired when a key is released
